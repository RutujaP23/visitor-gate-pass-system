# visitor-gate-pass-system
Digital visitor gate pass system with QR-based entry and exit verification.


## 📌 Project Overview

The **Android-Based Visitor Gate Pass System** is a secure, paperless, and automated visitor management solution designed to replace traditional manual gate registers at **Hari Om**. The system uses modern mobile and web technologies to streamline visitor entry and exit through **QR code–based digital gate passes**, improving security, accuracy, and operational efficiency.

This project was developed as a **Final Year B.Tech Project (Academic Year 2025–26)** under the Department of Computer Science & Engineering, **Annasaheb Dange College of Engineering and Technology, Ashta**, and was **sponsored by Zanvar Group, Kolhapur**.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Digitize and automate visitor gate pass management
* Eliminate paper-based visitor registers
* Enhance security using QR code verification
* Maintain accurate and searchable visitor records
* Enable real-time monitoring and reporting

---

## 🚩 Problem Statement

Most organizations rely on handwritten visitor registers, which are:

* Time-consuming and inefficient
* Prone to human error and data loss
* Difficult to audit and track
* Lacking real-time verification

This project addresses these challenges by providing a **mobile and web-based digital visitor management system**.

## 🧩 System Modules

### 1️⃣ User Module (Mobile Application)

* Secure user registration and login
* Online gate pass request submission
* Real-time request status tracking
* QR code generation after approval
* Email notifications for approval, entry, and exit
* History of previous visits

### 2️⃣ Admin & Security Module (Web Dashboard)

* Secure admin authentication
* View and manage visitor requests
* Approve or reject gate pass requests
* Automatic QR code generation
* QR code scanning for entry and exit
* Real-time visitor tracking
* Visitor logs and reports

---

## 🔄 System Workflow

1. Visitor/Employee submits a gate pass request via the mobile app
2. Admin reviews and approves or rejects the request via the web dashboard
3. Approved visitors receive a unique QR code via email
4. Security scans the QR code at entry and exit points
5. Entry and exit times are logged automatically in the database
